# The Little Schemer
There are something about my understanding of the book *The Little Schemer*.  
Well, there will be some scheme functions to show my understanding of TLS.

## First one:
- **hardest**,  
which means the hardest thinkings/concepts of the book's chapters.  
It also means you should pay your best time and energy to research it, to figure out it.
  
I've understood 95 percents of *The Little Schemer*,  
but I have no time to organize my notes about it. Well, I'll try to spare some time to do it.  
The book is charming, with little words, little pictures of little elephants. Enjoy it! :)  

To be continue...
